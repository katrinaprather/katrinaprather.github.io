  <h1>Project Requirements and Information</h1>

  <h3>Description</h3>

  <p>Relaxr was really impressed by your work last week and wants you to continue development on their landing page. Starting in class, you will work to build out a more complex layout for their company site. They decided on creating a blog, and their back-end engineers will be focused on developing the blog's functionality. They want your front-end skills to style their designs using HTML and CSS so Relaxr's engineers can begin integrating. Once again, the designers have handed you a basic design file with instructions (this file, and spec.txt) and the JPEG below to help you bring the blog to life. Submit the finished version for homework.</p>


  <h3>Technical Requirements</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Use in-line-block or floats in your CSS to achieve a two-column layout</li>
    <li>Use the correct <code>Open Sans</code> Google Font typeface to style the text denoted in the design file and according to the JPEG provided</li>
    <li>Use proper filename conventions (lowercase, .html)</li>
    <li>Use a single external CSS stylesheet to style all pages</li>
    <li>Use a background image for the headers</li>
    <li>Add a hover effect to all the links using pseudo-classes</li>
    <li>Integrate drop caps using pseudo-classes</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Bonus</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>Link the "Blog" link in the header to the page you've built for this assignment</li>
    <li>Link the "About" link in the header to the landing page you built last week</li>
    <li>Up for a real challenge? Use <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags in your HTML and <a href="https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-basics/">read ahead</a> to make a dialogue box pop up when a user clicks "Sign Up Now!" that reads "We're Not Ready For Sign-Ups...Yet."</li>
  </ul>
